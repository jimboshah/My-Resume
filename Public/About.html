<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi there! I’m someone who’s passionate about all things sport — whether it's the strategy and elegance of cricket, the fast pace and precision of squash, or the raw intensity of UFC, I’m always game for some action. 
  Sport, for me, is more than just entertainment — it’s a way to stay sharp, push limits, and appreciate the beauty of discipline and competition.</p>

<p>I’m a dedicated family man. My greatest joy comes from spending quality time with my wife and daughters — whether it’s a weekend outing, movie night at home, or just laughing together over dinner. 
  They’re my biggest supporters, my greatest motivation, and the heart of everything I do.</p>

<p>Life to me is about balance — staying active, staying present, and making the most of every moment.</p>
